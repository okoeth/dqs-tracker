# DQS Tracker

This Garmin Watch App helps you tracking for daily nutrition according to the
DQS (Dietry Quality Index) of [Matt Fitzgerald](http://racingweight.com).
I can also highly recommends Matt's book on the same subject which you
can find under the link above.

Right now the app is in MVP (Minimum Viable Product) status and can be used
in the following way:

* The app covers captures the DQS for the current day. For adding ietms for previous
days us the up / down buttons. The cursor moves to previous days in the footer
(boxes on the left), today is the right most box in the footer.

* The DQS status is shown by category using the following abbreviations: V - vegetables,
F - fruits, N - nuts and seeds, D - dairy, A - alcohol, G - whole grains (right) and 
refined grains (left), M - high quality meat (right) and low quality meat (left), 
B - high quality beverages (right) and low quality beverages (left), P - high
quality processed foods (right) and low quality processed foods (left), S -
sweets, R - fried foods.

* Throughout the day, track your DQS by adding the nutrition by selectin Menu / 
High Quality / Category or Menu / Low Quality / Category. There is also an option
to explicitly track alcohol consumption. 

Future roadmap items:

* Store daily DQS score in companion app (with cloud backend)
