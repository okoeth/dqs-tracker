# DQS Tracker

This Garmin Watch App helps you tracking for daily nutrition according to the
DQS (Dietry Quality Index) of [Matt Fitzgerald](http://racingweight.com).
I can also highly recommends Matt's book on the same subject which you
can find under the link above.

Right now the app is in MVP (Minimum Viable Product) status and can be used
in the following way:

* Start the app in the morning, select Menu / Reset. Now your DQS is reset to zero.

* Throughout the day, track your DQS by adding the nutrition by selectin Menu / 
High Quality / Category or Menu / Low Quality / Category. There is also an option
to explicitly track alcohol consumption. 

Future roadmap items:

* Show daily overview of DQS entries on Garmin watch

* Store daily DQS score in companion app (with cloud backend)
